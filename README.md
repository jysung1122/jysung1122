Currently, I am aspiring to become a **full-stack** or **back-end** developer, 
so I am studying **JSP** and **React** and creating a bulletin board with each language. 
I am working on a bulletin board project with **JSP** at school, and studying **React** & **Spring** at home.

I am consistently preparing for my future goals. Recognizing the importance of studying **algorithms** to prepare for coding tests, I have started solving 100 basic problems on Baekjoon. Aware of the importance of time management, I dedicate one hour each day to algorithm studies. Through these efforts, I am continuously **growing** and **striving** to become a better developer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on WSU
- 🌱 I learned JSP & RECT & AI and am currently reviewing C/C++
